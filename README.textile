h1. HTTP2XMPP

Based on Pedro Melo's "ideia":http://github.com/melo/codebits/tree/master/2008/xmpp-hands-on/bots/http2xmpp, I decided to rewrite his code with readable Ruby :P

The implementation is still incomplete, since I currently don't support sending raw XML in the middle of a message. I think XMPP4R::Simple currently not support this, so I'm planing to rewrite the code directly with XMPP4R.

h2. Dependencies

All dependencies can be installed with a simple @sudo gem install dep@:

* xmpp4r-simple
* xmpp4r
